One Puck Shot Trainer

The One Puck Shot Trainer is a simple air hockey learning tool built from an idea by Sammy and Chelsea. It uses a single puck in the center of the screen and changes the puck color, text, and explanation based on the selected shot. The goal is to help players learn shot names, families, paths, and visual cues in a quick and interactive way.

How It Works

The app places one large puck in the middle of the screen.
When you pick a shot family and a shot, the puck updates to show:
	•	A color that represents the shot family
	•	The shot name
	•	A variant or lane description
	•	A short coaching note
	•	Side and path information
	•	A link to a diagram for that specific motion

You can also hit Random Shot to cycle through the full library or Faceoff to reset to the starting position.

Shot Families Included
	•	Faceoff
	•	Basic Point
	•	Cross
	•	Cut
	•	Defense for straight shots
	•	Right Wall (Under and Over)
	•	Left Wall (Under and Over)
	•	Defense for wall shots
	•	Double Bank
	•	Triple Bank
	•	Turkey Shot

More can be added easily by expanding the shot list in the JavaScript file.

Contributing

If you want to add new shots, refinements, color themes, or expanded training modes, edit the SHOTS array in the script. Each shot entry includes:
	•	id
	•	family
	•	name
	•	variant
	•	note
	•	side
	•	path
	•	diagram
	•	tags

If you need help adding a full batch of new shots, just paste your list and I can build the structured objects for you.
